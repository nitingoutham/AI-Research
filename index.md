## Welcome to my AI research page

I intend to document my AI research from scratch for making the lives of other AI newbies like me much easier

Following the order of topics is imperative ( for anyone referencing my work )

I am aware of the urge to jump to much cooler topics right off the bat , but ORDER IS IMPERATIVE 

# Linear regression from scratch in python (  stochastic gradient descent )

# Logistic regression from scratch in python
