## Welcome to my AI research page

I intend to document my AI research from scratch for making the lives of other AI newbies like me much easier

Following the order of topics is imperative ( for anyone referencing my work )

I am aware of the urge to jump to much cooler topics right off the bat , but ORDER IS IMPERATIVE 

### What is machine learning and artificial intelligence ? both are same ?

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  

Artificial Intelligence is the famous field of study looking for ways to create computers that are capable of intelligent behaviour. A machine is deemed intelligent if it can do things normally associated with human intelligence. To pass the Turing Test and qualify as artificially intelligent, a machine should be able to do for example: natural language processing (i.e. communicate with no trouble on a given language); automated reasoning (using stored information to answer questions and draw new conclusions) and machine learning (the ability to adapt to new circumstances and detect patterns).

MACHINE LEARNING

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence and it explores the development of algorithms that learn from given data. These algorithms should be able to learn from past experience (i.e. the given data) and teach themselves to adapt to new circumstances and perform certain tasks.

## Hands on 
1. generative adversarial networks for fraud/anomaly detection

## Machine learning topics notes & codes ( from scratch)

### Linear regression from scratch in python (  stochastic gradient descent )

### Logistic regression from scratch in python
